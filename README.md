SQL schemas and scripts to analyse employees data

The ERD diagram shows the relationship of the data within the 6 csv files in "data folder".

The SQL schemas file will import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table. 

The SQL script file will do the following:
  - List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
  - List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.
  - List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.
  - List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
  - List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."
  - List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
  - List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
  - List the frequency count of employee last names (i.e., how many employees share each last name) in descending order.
